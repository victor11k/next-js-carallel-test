## Get Started

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`.
2. Add the `.env` file and add variables. You can use `.env.example` as an example to use configured Vercel and Next-Auth settings or configure by itself: [vercel-docs](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres), [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client)
3. Run `yarn dev` and visit <https://localhost:3000>.

## Linting

- `yarn lint` - checks for eslint, prettier, and TS errors

CI/CD pipeline automatically runs linter checks on push.
